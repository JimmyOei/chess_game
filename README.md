## Chess Game

This is a personal project. I am creating a chess game in C++ with SDL 2.0.

## Dev How to run
Below is the installation process for ubuntu:
1. Get GNU compiler tools and GDB debugger: `apt update ; apt install build-essential gdb`
2. Get SDL2 and SDL2_image library: `apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev`
3. Compile: `make`
4. Run: `./Chess_game`

## TODO
- end interface (implement mate, winning the game)

*Ideas*
- random move opponent
